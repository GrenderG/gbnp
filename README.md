# GBNP: Game Boy Nintendo Power ROM Builder

This tool can build the data necessary to flash new games to a [Nintendo Power Game Boy cart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power_(cartridge)). The cartridge can store up to seven roms, or a total of 896KB of game data. For flashing, I recommend the [GBxCart](https://www.gbxcart.com/).
